Step-by-Step Guide: Building the Retail Sales & Returns Dashboard in Power BI

1. Import & Transform Data

Load data from Superstore.xlsx into Power BI

Use Power Query to:

Remove whitespace from headers

Convert Order Date, Ship Date to Date type

Left join Returns to Orders using Order ID

Merge People to Orders by Region


2. Define Data Model

Ensure these relationships:

Orders[Order ID] ⇄ Returns[Order ID]

Orders[Region] ⇄ People[Region]


3. Build Key DAX Measures

Total Sales = SUM(Orders[Sales])
Total Returns = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Returns), Orders[OrderID] IN VALUES(Returns[OrderID]))
Total Profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])
Total Quantity = SUM(Orders[Quantity])
Total Discount = SUM(Orders[Discount])
Return Rate = DIVIDE([Returned Orders], DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID]), 0)
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)


4. Create Report Pages

Page 1: Superstore Dashboard

KPI cards: Sales, Profit, Quantity, Return Rate

Sales by State (Map)

Return Rate by Category (Bar)

Time-Series: Total Sales vs Profit (Line)

Sales by Year (Bar)

Sales by Ship Mode (Donut)


5. Add Filters & Slicers

Date Range (Order Date)

Segment, Region, Category slicers for exploration


6. Export & Publish

Save .pbix to /pbix

Export PNG of final dashboard to /images

Push to GitHub with: README.md, step-by-step-guide.md, Excel source, PBIX file, and dashboard snapshot
